<a name="faq"></a>

## **FAQ**

#### **1.How many instances of the program I can run simultaneously for same account?**

I will recommend to host/run 3 or less than 3 (< 3) instances for each account because Cloudflare's API have request limits. Hosting/Running too many instances can cause "429" error which indicates that API is getting too many requestes from the same account or IP and that's why there is a cooldown timer of 30-50 seconds to prevent this.

#### **2.How to resolve "429" error?**

First make sure you are running 3 or less than 3 (<3) instances of this program for same account and if this error still persist then possible reason can be that you or platform where you hosted this program is making use of shared IPs, prefer using dedicated IPs. Try running this in your personal devices.

#### **3.Will this program cause any kind of ban from Cloudflare?**

No, this program NOT cause ban because it just use the API provided by Cloudflare for referral system. Neither this program create any type of load or bypass any limit set by Cloudflare for their API nor it hacks anything or changes any official record illegally.

#### **5.Why use this program? we can simply use any mod of WARP app?**

WARP+ is for lifting the speed cap imposed by Cloudflare on free users which is server-side limit and it can't be bypassed by just modifying client-side code. WARP+ will also bypass proxies like Fortinet.
